<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are a lot of little challenges we do applying for developer position. This repo come from one of those that want a production style code in a simple task.

What is important in production:
* Test your code! (Agile is already 20 y.o.)
* Document: let's communicate well
* If want to be SOLID, refact it using DDD and clean thinking and smile! :smile:

For this challenge there feature required some Business Rules.

* should return a string with the path of unordered travels

For me it is always important that your System require error handling, here showed throwing error if invalid input or inconclusive output.


### Built With

This repo is built using JavaScript for Node and tested using Mocha (Chai Assert). (Too Vanilla?)

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To check this code, clone it and use as a Service or Util file or check it using  TDD (Test Driven Development) principle: you can easily run the test script and start seeing how the repo was thought.

### Prerequisites

To use JavaScript out of the browser NODE.JS is the popular form. I recommend it but you can also recommend check Deno, a new JS V8 runner (keep it on track at least).

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Deno](https://deno.land)

## Other interesting repositories

1. [Hasura Next.js boilerplate](https://nirmalyaghosh.com/guides/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate)


### Coding and Testing

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/matheusheck/replay-board-game
   ```
2. Run the bootstrap script by running the following command from the root of your project:
   ```sh
   cd nextjs-hasura-boilerplate && yarn bootstrap
   ```

3. Create a Google OAuth Client from
  https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient and copy the credentials to GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in your .env file inside the frontend directory.

4. Start Docker and run both the applications by running the following command from the root of your project:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
  We need to start Docker and then run the above command (with at least 4gb dedicated). The Hasura console will be available at http://localhost:8080/console. The Hasura GraphQL endpoint will be up and running on http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql. The Next.js application will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Testing

To test your code is very easy once the is a script test that runs mocha on the terminal.

```sh
   npm test
   ```

   ```sh
   yarn test
   ```



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
(Sorry for committed on master, it was a 'gambiarra' to develop alone faster...)

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
